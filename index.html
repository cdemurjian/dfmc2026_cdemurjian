      <h2>MY STORY</h2>
      <h3>Why do I run?</h3>
      <p>
        I first got into running when some friends and I organized a
        <a href="https://www.orkanolgacmemorial.org/" target="_blank">5K</a> in memory of a close high school friend who had passed away.
        He was a passionate runner, and that event was a way for all of us to honor him.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as a tribute quickly became something more. Running has since become a staple in my life.
        The mental and physical effects of running are truly remarkable. My mental and physical health have transformed,
        and running is a major reason for that.

    <section class="why fade-in">
      <h3>Why Dana-Farber?</h3>
      <p>
        Cancer has touched many parts of my life. My best friend from college watched both of his parents battle, and beat, cancer.
        My girlfriend’s grandmother, who has been a maternal figure to her, lost her husband far too young.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cancer is inescapable; everyone you know has been touched by it in some way.
        When I decided I wanted to run Boston in 2026 through a charity bid, choosing Dana-Farber was a no-brainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        My day job is also cancer-research-focused.
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdemurjian/" target="_blank">I work</a> as the Lead Data Specialist at the
        <a href="https://bmcwiki.mit.edu/index.php/BioMicroCenter" target="_blank">MIT BioMicro Center</a>,
        supporting several large-scale research projects ranging from cancer research to immunology and environmental remediation.
        Additionally, I am the Koch Institute’s
        <a href="https://breakthroughcancer.org/" target="_blank">Break Through Cancer</a> Data Coordinator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being part of such great collaborative efforts only further cemented my choice to run and support Dana-Farber.
      </p>
      <p><strong>
        I'm ready to take on 26.2 miles — not just for myself, but for every life touched by cancer.
        My goal is to raise $20,000 for Dana-Farber’s lifesaving research, and with your support, I know we can go even further.
