      <h2>MY STORY</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Why do I run?</h3>
      <p>I first got into running when some friends and I organized a 5K in memory of a close high school friend who had
        passed away. He was a passionate runner, and that event was a way for all of us to honor him.</p>
      <p>What started as a tribute quickly became something more. Running has since become a staple in my life. The
        mental and physical effects of running are truly remarkable. My mental and physical health have transformed, and
        running is a major reason for that. What started as honoring a friend, turned into something that transformed my
        life.</p>
      <h3>Why Dana-Farber?</h3>
      <p>Cancer has touched many parts of my life. My best friend from college watched both of his parents battle, and
        beat, cancer. My girlfriends grandmother, who has been a maternal figure to her, lost her husband far too young.
      </p>
      <p>Cancer is inescapable; everyone you know has been touched by it in some way. When I decided I wanted to run
        Boston in 2026 through a charity bid, choosing Dana-Farber was a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>My day job is also cancer research focused. I work as the Lead Data Specialist at the MIT BioMicro Center. I
        lead a team that supports several large-scale research projects, ranging from cancer research, immunology,
        environmental remediation, endometriosis, and more. Additionally, I am the Koch Institute's Break Through Cancer
        Data Coordinator.</p>
      <p>Being a part of such great collaborative efforts only further cemented my choice to run and support Dana
        Farber.</p>
      <p><strong>I'm ready to take on 26.2 miles &mdash; not just for myself, but for every life touched by cancer. My
          goal is
          to
          raise $20,000 for Dana-Farber's lifesaving research, and with your support, I know we can go even
          further.</strong></p>
